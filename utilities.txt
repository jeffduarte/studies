make sure to read a code without (...) this if trigger a statement, else this is going to happen, so, later they will make that (...)

it's inefficient, you are reading like a computer, you have to read like a human being, watch the meaning of things, what it's up to what each part of code is designed for, and later join this understanding in something useful

In thirds codes you have to make a human read, so, after understand the meaning of the code you have to make a computer read, or table test to fetch the bug, if it's a logic bug, in the human read you will note that is something wrong.
